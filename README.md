# TF-B1 - high-altitude balloon experimental platform

![Experimental high-altitude balloon illustration](doc/img/platform_illustration.png)

Pressurized stratospheric balloons, designed for several-hour flights, provide a unique platform for specialized experimental and research applications. These balloons, capable of ascending to altitudes around 30 kilometers, are ideal for short-term, high-altitude atmospheric research. They enable critical data collection on atmospheric conditions, including temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations. This information is crucial for understanding short-term weather phenomena and contributes to the development of more accurate weather prediction models.

In aerospace and materials testing, these pressurized balloons are invaluable. Their ability to reach near-space environments quickly allows for the efficient testing of spacecraft components and materials under conditions of reduced gravity, extreme temperatures, and high radiation levels. This provides a cost-effective and timely method for validating the resilience and performance of aerospace technologies before their deployment in more challenging space missions.

Furthermore, their short-duration flights make pressurized stratospheric balloons particularly suited for educational purposes. They offer a practical platform for students and researchers to conduct high-altitude experiments within a manageable timeframe. This not only fosters hands-on experience in scientific research and experimentation but also ignites interest and enthusiasm in the fields of science and technology, particularly among young learners and aspiring scientists.
